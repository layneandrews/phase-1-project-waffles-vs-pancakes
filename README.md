This is a project made by Cahen, Casey and Layne for our phase 1 Flatiron School project. 
Our application is a digital implementation of the ice breaker game "Waffles VS. Pancakes"
The user of our application will be presented with 2 different food options and be asked to keep only one of them.
There will be a comments section where users can make notes and present their case for why a given food item should be kept over the alternative.
There will be a timer at the top of the application that counts down from 60. 
When the timer reaches zero, the users selection will be submitted automatically and the game will move to the next round.
When all of the food items have been eliminated the users will be left with one food item that 'wins'.

If you are a developer who is wanting to add or contribute to this project, please feel free to fork a copy of this repo to your local machine where you can play with the code.
This project is implemented using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, all of which have a dedicated file in this repository. 
We are currently fetching our data for this project from a local json server using a local db.json file.

Enjoy!!!
