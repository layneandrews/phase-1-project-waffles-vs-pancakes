# Introduction

This project is a digital implementation of the ice breaker game "Waffles VS. Pancakes".

## Installation

Fork and clone a copy of the repository at: https://github.com/layneandrews/phase-1-project-waffles-vs-pancakes. Navigate to the main directory and run <explorer.exe index.html> for Windows, and <> on Macintosh systems.

## Usage

To use the application, decide which food option you would keep if you could only pick one and select the 'Pick Me!' button below that food. At that point, you will be presented with a choice between the food you chose and a new, different food item. This process will repeat indefinitely. The game is intended to be an icebreaker activity in both office and casual settings that will enhance team building, communication and relationships. Hovering over an image will display a unique fact about that particular food item. Clicking on the comments button will display a text box where you can type and post comments, thoughts or feelings about your food choices, the game or anything else that comes to mind!

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.


## Future Development

In future phases of this project our team plans to expand the functionality of our app to support and encourage multiplayer usage both in person and online. Some added features will include:
•	A built-in countdown timer display
•	Sound effects
•	Team assignment and scorekeeping functionality
•	Support for multiple clients/browsers
We would also like to improve the code with an expanded database or API integration, and the ability to eliminate items from being included in the selection process once they have already been chosen.
